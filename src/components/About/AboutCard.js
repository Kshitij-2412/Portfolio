            Hi Everyone ðŸ‘‹,
            <br />
            <br />
            I'm <span className="purple">Kshitij Agarwal</span>, a final year student at NIT Jalandhar, originally from <span className="purple">Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh</span>. Currently, I'm interning at <span className="purple">DRDO</span> in New Delhi, where I'm honing my coding and technical skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me on the <span className="purple">basketball court</span> or exploring new destinations. I love balancing my passion for coding with my love for <span className="purple">sports and travel</span>.
            <br />
            <br />
            Looking forward to connecting with you all !
          </p>
